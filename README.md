# MKProjects CLI 
This repo contains all of the CLI versions of my electron apps, and brings a way to just get 
the experience with a few commands. 
</br>
These CLI will have the same sort of runtime setup, as both will be designed similarly. 
</br>

Simply use the `run` script in the respective directories the run the app, if
you use the save option in the commands. They will be found in `src/Phaktionz`, 
but make sure before using any commands to do the following: 

```bash
Phaktionz-Wiki CLI 
MKProjects Version 1.0.0 
Phaktionz >> Init
Initialize Complete 
Phaktionz >> Now Proceed
```

Caution: Make sure to not let the app run for a long time, can cause computer to slow or crash. (Infinite Loop)
